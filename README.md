# A low-featured but working signshop...

## Features:
* interfaces with vault to do economy things
* a fun theme that involves 'blessing' and 'deconsecrating' signs (which, in essence, is synonymous to setting signs to be 'active' or 'inactive' respectively)
* robust checks to ensure only authorized users are able to create/destroy actively blessed signs
* maintains a special admin list in case you'd like to give users the ability to bless/deconsecrate signs without making them into server ops
* a 'buy' and 'sell' format that enables you to customize how many items you'd like your sign to buy or sell, and for how much
* preeeeeety colors differentiating blessed and unblessed signs üòç
